Question3

What is a mutator method? Explain why mutator methods usually return the value
None.

"""
Answer to the Question3

A mutator method modifies the internal state of an object. 
A mutator metthod returns the value None because its purpose is just to modify the state of an object.

a list of numbers as an argument and return a single number. Each function should
return 0 if the list is empty. Include a main function that tests the three statistical
